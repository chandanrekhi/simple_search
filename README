SimpleSearch
============

From time to time, I need to build pages to show a list of narrowed down records from database by giving 
some searching criteria on some columns on the table or some referencing tables (not full-text searching). 
I get the search criteria from the params hash individually in controller and put them into instance variables 
to be used in views. After getting the search criteria, I build the SQL where clause and sometimes the join clause.

After using this pattern a few times, I realized I could DRY the process somehow to make the coding much simpler.
That's where the SimpleSearch plugin comes from.


Example
=======

Code in controller:

      @search_criteria = SearchCriteria.new(params[:search_criteria])
      @users = User.all(:conditions => @search_criteria.conditions)

Code in views:

     <% form_for @search_criteria do |f| %>
       <%=f.label :first_name %>
       <%=f.text_field :first_name %>
       
       <%=f.label :last_name%>
       <%=f.text_field :last_name %>

       <%=f.label :login%>
       <%=f.text_field :login%>
     <% end %>

     <% @users.each do |user| %>
      <%= # show the attributes of user %>
     <% end %>
